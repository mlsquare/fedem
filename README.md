## Introduction
The emergence of ChatGPT captured widespread attention, marking the first instance where individuals outside of technical circles could engage with Generative AI. This watershed moment sparked a surge of interest in cultivating secure applications of foundational models, alongside the exploration of domain-specific or community-driven alternatives to ChatGPT. Notably, the unveiling of LLaMA 2, an LLM generously open-sourced by Meta, catalyzed a plethora of advancements. This release fostered the creation of diverse tasks, tools, and resources, spanning from datasets to novel models and applications. Additionally, the introduction of Phi 2, an SLM by Microsoft, demonstrated that modestly-sized models could rival their larger counterparts, offering a compelling alternative that significantly reduces both training and operational costs.

Yet, amid these strides, challenges persist. The training of foundational models within current paradigms demands substantial GPU resources, presenting a barrier to entry for many eager contributors from the broader community. In light of these obstacles, we advocate for FedEm.

<b>FedEm (Federated Emergence)</b> stands as an open-source library dedicated to decentralizing the training process of foundational models, with a commitment to transparency, responsibility, and equity. By empowering every member of the community to participate in the training and fine-tuning of foundational models, FedEm mitigates the overall computational burden per individual, fostering a more democratic approach to model development. In essence, FedEm epitomizes a paradigm shift, where foundational models are crafted not just for the people, but by the people, ensuring inclusivity and collective ownership throughout the training journey.


<h2> FedEm Framework </h2>
FedEm proposes a methodology to train a foundational model continuously, utilizing adapters. FedEm can be elaborated in mainly two sections. Decentralization of adapter training using CRFs and large scale updation using continuous pretraining checkpoints.

<h3> Continuous Relay Finetuning (CRF) </h3>
<p align="center">

  <b>Continuous Relay Finetuning</b>
</p>
We introduce the concept of continuous relay finetuning (CRF), which employs parameter-efficient LoRA adapters in a relay-like fashion for training foundational models. In this method, a client conducts local training of an adapter on a specified dataset, followed by its transmission to a cloud server for subsequent download by another client for further finetuning. FedEm ensures the continuous training of adapters, which are subsequently merged with a foundational model to create an updated model. CRF facilitates community engagement throughout the training process and offers a transparent framework for tracking and continuously updating adapters as new data becomes available, thereby enhancing the adaptability and inclusivity of AI development efforts.

<h3> Continuous Pretraining(CPT) </h3>

The server-side cloud hub exhibits the capability for perpetual training and deployment of refreshed foundational models at specified intervals, such as monthly or daily cycles. Simultaneously, the CRF adapters engage in iterative refinement against these newly updated models, fostering continual adaptation in response to evolving datasets.

<h3> Selective locking of adapters </h3>

For continuous relay finetuning, It is important to schedule the adapter training in a fashion that no two clients have the same adapter for training at one point of time. To ensure this access control, we use a time-dependent adapter scheduling. A client downloads an adapter at time T. The adapter will get locked for any other client i.e. cannot be finetuned till one client does not stop finetuning of that adapter. The hub checks periodically in every 5 minutes for access control of adapters. The adapter gets unlocked if any of the following conditions are met:
- time elapsed for finetuning adapter A > 3 hours.
- client pushes the finetuned adapters before 3 hours.


<h3> Seshu </h3>
Majority, if not all the LLMs, we see today are based on proven Transformer based architectures. And Transfomres have quadratic (in inputs tokens) complexity - therefore slow to train and infer. As a result, new memory and compute efficient attention mechanisms have sprungup, along with Engineering hacks. But, at the end of the day, they are still based on Transformer-based architectures.
</br></br>
Further, majority, with the exception of some Chinese LLMs, are English-centric and other languages have a token representation (no pun intended). Often, LLMs have a particulalr tokenizer -- which makes extension to other languages/ domains hard. Vocabulary size and Transfomers Computational Efficiency have an uneasy relationship. Developing SLMs or LLMs is still a compute heavy problem. Therefore, only large consortia with deep pockets, massive talent concentration and GPU farms can afford to build such models.

## Client side

Example: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/mlsquare/fedem/blob/main/notebooks/fedem_seshu_client.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a>

#### Pre-reqs
 - has GPU, registers on HuggingFace/mlsquare for write access
 - familair with HuggingFace ecosystem (transfomers, peft, datasets, hub)
 - [optional] can donate time or data or both

#### Actions:
Runs client side script which
 - downloads data, pretrains model
 - SFTs via LoRA
 - pushes the adapter to HuggingFace model hub


## Server (who manages the federated learning)

Example: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/mlsquare/fedem/blob/main/notebooks/fedem_seshu_server.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

#### Pre-reqs
- has (big) GPU(s)
- is familair with HuggingFace ecosystem (transfomers, peft, datasets, hub), databases, ML Enginneering in general
- [optional] can donate time or data or both

#### Actions:
 - Pretrains a multi-lingual Mamba model, publishes a checkpoint
 - Evaluated the community contributed adapters in a single-blind fashion, and merges them into the pretrained model
 - Does continous pretrainning, and releases checkpoints periodically

### Academic Interests
 - experiment and identify good federating learning policies
 - figure out effective training configurations to PT, CPT, SFT, FedT SLMs and LLMs
 - develop new task specific adapters
 - contribute your local, vernacular data
 - curate datasets

Fedem is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute, you can create new features, fix bugs, or improve the infrastructure. Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mlsquare/fedem/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the repository for more information on how to contribute.

The views expressed or approach being taken - is of the individuals, and they do not represent any organization explicitly or implicitly.
Likewise, anyone who wants to contribute their time, compute or data must understand that, this is a community experiment to develop LLMs by the community, and may not result in any significant outcome. On the contrary, this may end up in total failure. The contributors must take this risk on their own.
